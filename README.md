# Example Kindergarten Application
  - The application was created with Xamarin.

### Sign-In and Sign-Up
  - The application language is not English. It was prepared in Turkish. After downloading this repo, you can change the content according to your intended use.
  - The application has login, registration, home, and settings screens. Page transitions were made with a tabbed page.
  - No database connection was made, but 1 user was added manually for testing purposes.
  - username: **admin** // password: **12345**
    
### Home and Settings Screens
  - There is feedback at the end of the registration process, but no data is transferred anywhere.
  - There is a slider on the home screen and the buttons are non-functional.
  - Only the Log Out button is active on the settings screen.
  - There is no database connection. Therefore, images within the application were added manually.
